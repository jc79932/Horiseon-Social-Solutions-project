# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this project, I modified and corrected certain aspects, to which include but are not limited to: Modified divs -> semantic tags, updated the title to closely match the page, corrected
any broken links/redirects, added Alt attributes to img tags, ensured that elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, ensured the heading attributes
fall in appropiate order, and commented/reorganized HTML and CSS code.
